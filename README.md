This repository contains the R Scripts to run the shiny App developed for RAM Mannheim e.V. 

IMPORTANT: You may need an authentication key being able to use the deeplr-package for the translation. It may occur that without an authentication key our app doesn't work.
If that is the case feel free to contact us so we can find a solution: johannes.reithmeier@students.uni-mannheim.de

In our app we use dummy data to test and demonstrate the app, but you can use any excel-file that has the same structure as ours. For reading in the excel file it is
important that the name of the excel file contains the following date format: '20[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]_[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}.xlsx', e.g. 'funding_overview_all_2023-04-01_18-30'
